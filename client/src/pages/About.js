      <h1>Why we built Charity Shop Exchange</h1>
      <p>
        With the COVID-19 pandemic reaching all parts of the world, a global
        team of web developers, designers and makers have come together to
        address some of the challenges we all face being isolated.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first we pictured the delight people get from receiving books and
        DVDs and thought about how delivering these items to doorsteps could
        help combat isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there we set out to see how the subscription-box-service 
        business model could be retrofitted into the landscape of local
        charity shops, of which we have more than ten thousand in the UK.      
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        A nationwide network of charity shops <em>meets</em> cooperative
        approach <em>meets</em> online subscription box service.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This fast response and joined-up thinking serve as inspiration for
        many other use cases, where a dedicated online service could take
        orders on behalf of a syndication of suppliers. And we're open to
        working together on digital projects that see the value in this
        approach.
